        "explanation": "A simple checksum's main weakness is that it can fail to detect certain errors. For example, if one bit flips from 1 to 0 and another flips from 0 to 1, the errors can 'cancel out' in the final sum, leading to a false pass. A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is a more robust algorithm designed to catch such common data errors."
