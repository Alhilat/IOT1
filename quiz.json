        "answer_index": 1,
        "explanation": "An embedded system is designed to perform a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. Unlike a general-purpose computer (like a laptop), it's a specialized combination of computer hardware and software for a specific task, such as the system inside a microwave oven."

        ],
        "answer_index": 0,
        "explanation": "The presentation slide explicitly states that the two main types of RAM are SRAM (Static RAM) and DRAM (Dynamic RAM). ROM, EPROM, Flash, and EEPROM are all forms of Read-Only Memory."

        ],
        "answer_index": 1,
        "explanation": "DRAM (Dynamic RAM) loses its data very quickly (4 times a second) even with power, so it requires a DRAM controller to constantly refresh it. SRAM retains data as long as power is on without refreshing."
      },
      {
        "chapter": "Chapter 6",
        "question": "Why is SRAM typically used for critical speed-sensitive tasks instead of main system memory?",

        ],
        "answer_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Masked ROM is preprogrammed with hardwired transistors during the manufacturing process. No changes can be made after it leaves the factory, so it is only cost-effective for stable, finalized code in large volumes (100,000+ units)."

          "EEPROM has unlimited write cycles, while Flash does not."
        ],
        "answer_index": 2,
        "explanation": "A key feature of EEPROM is its ability to be erased or rewritten at the byte level. Flash memory, while also electrical, must be erased in larger 'sectors' or 'blocks' (e.g., 8KB-64KB)."

          "A type of ROM that can be written to once."
        ],
        "answer_index": 1,
        "explanation": "NVRAM stands for Nonvolatile RAM. It consists of standard SRAM paired with a battery. When main power is on, it acts like normal SRAM, and when power is off, the battery preserves the data, making it non-volatile."

          "It allows data transfers between devices and memory without CPU involvement, freeing the CPU.",
          "It erases Flash memory sectors automatically."
        ],
        "answer_index": 2,
        "explanation": "DMA is a technique that offloads data transfer tasks from the CPU. Instead of the CPU manually moving each byte, a DMA controller handles the transfer directly, which frees up the CPU to perform other processing tasks."

        "explanation": "Address signal faults, like a short or open wire, cause incorrect address decoding. This leads to 'overlapping addresses,' where two different addresses point to the same physical location, causing data written to one to overwrite the other. Stuck bits are a symptom of data signal faults."

        "explanation": "If the data cache is enabled, it can 'fake' a successful memory test. Writes might only go to the cache and not to the physical RAM, and reads might be served from the cache.

For example, if one bit flips from 1 to 0 and another flips from 0 to 1, the errors can 'cancel out' in the final sum, leading to a false pass. A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is a more robust algorithm designed to catch such common data errors."
